Hack of a force directed graph, tranposed from a python algorithm by Mathias Bader
Does not do layout - just used to get coordinates for the nodes of a graph so that these can be plugged into javascript
tools like js-plumb to get an initial layout.  Once we have an initial layout we want to store it, so we only need to
call this once when setting up a new graph
