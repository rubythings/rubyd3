# rubyd3
A force directed graph, tranposed into ruby from a python algorithm by Mathias Bader.
My version does not do layout - just used to get coordinates for the nodes of a graph so that these can be plugged into javascripttools like js-plumb to get an initial layout.  Once we have an initial layout we want to store it, so we only need to call this once when setting up a new graph
